  "Hi there! I'm Lavinia*, a Web Developer and designer with 4 years of experience, based in Bucharest, Romania. I'm a fan of squiggly shapes, web development, computer graphics, and generative art. Primarily, I worked as a Web Developer for Adobe & Ubisoft, where Iâ€™ve been knee-deep in React, TypeScript, and WebGL magic. I also dabble in TouchDesigner, videography and retro tech. Got an idea for your next project? I'd love to hear it!";
