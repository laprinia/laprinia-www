Computed the resulting color by picking a random point inside a unit radius sphere, whose normal starts from the initial ray hit point. This is done recursively until a ray doesn't hit anything or a maximum depth is reached.\n" +
          "3. For metallic surfaces, rays aren't randomly scattered. Luckily, GLSL has the reflect function which returns the reflected ray. Randomizing the reflected ray by choosing a random endpoint as we did for the matte surface, we can get more rough (fuzzy) surfaces.\n"+
          "4. For a dielectric surface, a ray is split into both a reflected one and a refracted one. Assuming that all rays are only refracted we get this result. Using Schlick's polynomial approximation we can determine if rays must pe reflected instead of refracted, giving the final result.\n"+
          "5. Next is adding a Cornell Box for more complexity in the scene. To make things more realistic, I added an emissive material for some ceiling lights & spheres. Rays hitting an emissive surface won't scatter so they retain their true albedo color output.\n"+
           "6. On the Post Processing layer, I added HDR, so the emissive material pops out more. I also added Bloom, which basically renders our lights as blurred (using Gaussian Blur), and adds the result on top of the base color."
