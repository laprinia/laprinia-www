            "  <li><h3>üîç Research & Planning</h3> I began by identifying the key sections of the website: a Landing Page for a quick introduction, a Portfolio Overview for an at-a-glance view of all projects, Individual Project Pages for detailed insights, and an About Page for personal background and contact information.</li>\n" +
            "  <li><h3>üñåÔ∏è Design & Prototyping</h3> Using Figma, I designed wireframes and high-fidelity mockups to visualize the site layout and interactions. I selected Adobe Fonts, specifically Raleway, for its minimalist and elegant appearance. I also utilized Adobe Photoshop for crafting mockup images and applying text textures, ensuring a polished visual presentation. Adobe Rush was used to create short, impactful videos for my project showcases.</li>\n" +
            "  <li><h3>üé® Visual Design & Accessibility</h3> The color palette was chosen to balance a clean look with bold accents: a soft background color (#F6F6F6) paired with striking blue tones (#0141D5, #0136af, #002986). These colors were applied thoughtfully to maintain accessibility and contrast ratios. Typography breakpoints were defined for XL desktops, desktops, tablets, and phones, ensuring readability across all devices.</li>\n" +
            "  <li><h3>üíª Development & Implementation</h3> Leveraged Next.js for SEO optimization and fast page loading. Used React with TypeScript for type safety and component reusability. Integrated react-three-fiber for dynamic 3D text animations, bringing the site to life, and Framer Motion for smooth transitions and micro-interactions. Focused on a mobile-first responsive design that adapts seamlessly from small screens to large desktops, offering unique perspectives for different devices.</li>\n" +
            "  <li><h3>üñºÔ∏è Content Structure & Navigation</h3> The content was structured to allow easy navigation: the Landing Page offers a clear introduction, while the Portfolio section provides a snapshot of each project. Individual Project Pages delve into technologies used, code snippets, and include a mixed-media carousel of images and videos. The About Page connects visitors to my background and personal interests.</li>\n" +
